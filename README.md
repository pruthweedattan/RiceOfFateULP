# Rice Of Fate üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team GC


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pruthwee Dattan - SJC Devagiri
- Member 2: Muhammed Nazil - SJC Devagiri

### Project Description
A whimsical web app where every grain of rice hides the name of someone ‚Äúdestined‚Äù to eat it ‚Äî along with a hilariously humiliating astrological fact generated by AI.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People eat rice every day, yet nobody truly knows which grain belongs to them. The universe is clearly slacking in record‚Äëkeeping.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solved this fake cosmic problem by making a digital rice field. Click on any grain, zoom in, and the stars (well, Gemini AI) will reveal the person fated to eat it ‚Äî and roast them with a mystical, useless prediction.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software
Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript

Frameworks: React (with Vite), Tailwind CSS

Libraries: lucide-react (icons), Gemini API (Google Generative AI)

Tools: Node.js, npm, GitHub

For Hardware
None ‚Äî unless you count our laptops and the rice we stared at for inspiration.
